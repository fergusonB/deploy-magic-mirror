# Deno Deploy Magic Mirror
This is a script meant to run on [Deno deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) that will fetch time to work, weather, news, and the current time and display it on a dark background in portrait mode.

It is designed for my home made magic mirror that uses a raspberry pi running chromium in kiosk mode on a 9:16 display.
